Q.1). What is Microservice architecture?
Ans. It is a development style that allows to develop application as a collection of small services. In Microservices 
	the development is done based on different modules acoording to requirement and their is separate deployments
	for every module. The application handles Http Request and returns HTML/XML response to client.

Q.2). What are the advantages of microservices?
Ans. 1. Microservices can be written in a variety of programming languages, and frameworks, and each service acts as a 
	mini-application on its own. 
     2. Application is broken into smaller modules that are easy for developers to code and maintain.
     3. Large applications remain largely unaffected by the failure of a single module.
     4. Microservices enable data separation. Each service has its own database, making it harder for hackers to compromise
	your application.

Q.3). Write down the port of microservices components?
Ans. Spring Cloud Config Server          8888
     Netflix Eureka NAming Server        8761
     Netflix Zuul API GAteway Server     8765
     Zipkin Distributed Tracing Server   9411

Q.4). What are the components of microservices?
Ans. 	Spring Cloud Config Server
	Netflix Eureka Naming Server
	Hystrix Server
	Netflix ZuulAPI Gateway Server
	Netflix Ribbon
	Zipkin Distributed Tracing Server
