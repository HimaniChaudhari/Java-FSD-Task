Q.1. What is sdlc?
Ans.  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, 
      low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time.
      - Planning and analysis.
      - Designing the product architecture.
      - Developing and coding.
      - Testing.
      - Maintenance.

Q.2. Types of sdlc models?

     integration, and maintenance.

Q.4. What is Agile Model?
Ans. Agile methodology is a practice which promotes continues interaction of development and testing during the SDLC 
     process of any project. In the Agile method, the entire project is divided into small incremental builds. All of 
     these builds are provided in iterations, and each iteration lasts from one to three weeks.

Q.8. What are the scrum ceremonies available? and give 2 points about each meeting...like what's the usage of meeting and 
     how frequent it should happen?
Ans. 1. Sprint Planning - Sprint Planning is the scrum ceremony designed to make sure the team is prepared to get the right 
                          things done every sprint. 
                          In terms of Sprint Planning, it should last 2 times the length of the sprint (in hours). For 
                          example, if your sprint is 2 weeks long, the Sprint Planning ceremony should last no longer than 
                          4 hours.   

     2. Daily Scrum - The Daily Scrum is the team’s chance to get together, define a plan for the day’s work, and identify 
                      any blockers.
                      It should last no more than 15 minutes. Easier said than done.

     3. Sprint Review - The Sprint Review is the scrum ceremony where all work completed during the sprint can be showcased 
                        the stakeholders.
                        One hour per week of the sprint. As an example, a two-hour Sprint Review should be scheduled for a 
                        two-week sprint.

     4. Sprint Retrospective - After a Sprint Review has been conducted, the scrum team needs to have the opportunity to 
                               reflect on the work that was just showcased and discuss ways in which to improve. The sprint
                               retrospective is that meeting.
                               Sprint retrospectives should last no more than 1.5 hours for a two-week sprint.
